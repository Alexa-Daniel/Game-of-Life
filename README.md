# Game-of-Life
A C++ console application displaying John Conway's Game of Life on a 2d array given as input by the user in the file "joc.in".

# How to use
Download and unzip the repository, then change the array from the file "joc.in" (the first two values represent the number of lines and columns and then the actual array in which 1's represent live cells and 0's represent dead cells) or otherwise leave the already existing array. \
Run "main.exe", wait for the initial array to appear, and then on each ENTER press the next step will be displayed. If multiple characters are input and then ENTER is pressed, the application will do as many steps as characters were put in.
